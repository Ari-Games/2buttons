# Control:

In the game, only two buttons are used to control: A and D. The more difficult the combination, the more damage you do! But in order to open new attacks, you need to get a sufficient number of points. Acquire your agility and be patient, who, like you, can save the alliance of people and dogs from the evil Touch-en.
